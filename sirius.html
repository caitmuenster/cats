        Wind blows through the trees <br />
        The stars shift with the seasons <br />

        Sirius has achieved a level of Zen that many seek and few attain. He
        leads a simple life and lets unimportant things slide off his back as
        water slides from a duck.

        Sirius has short, stumpy legs and a round belly, and his footsteps make
        a distinctive sound as he trots around the house. He is also a
        connoiseur of the most luxurious comfortable locations to curl up and
        sleep away the afternoon, such as the towel closet or Caitlin's office
        chair. He is perfectly happy staring into space without any focus until
        inevitably his eyes close and he falls asleep.

        <p>
          Sirius is rarely referred to by his name, which is fine because he
          doesn't appear to know what his name is. Potch has compiled a
