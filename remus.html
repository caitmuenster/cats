      <h2>Remus</h2>
      <p>
        Don't be fooled by first impressions. Remus may appear to be a shy and
        timid, but he's just waiting to see if you will be his new food
        dispensor and/or snuggle buddy.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of nature's born project managers, Remus wants to keep an eye on
        everything his humans do. There is no task too small, no chore too
        mundane for Remus. He will gladly supervise and participate in any
        activity that does not involve the hated vacuum cleaner.

        How does this executive cat stay on top of his workload? We found a copy
        of his schedule and learned just how this one cat manages to have it
        all.
