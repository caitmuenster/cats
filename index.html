      <h2>Their Story</h2>
      <p>
        After being removed from a home with "too many cats" by San Francisco
        Animal Care and Control, Caitlin adopted Remus and Sirius (n√©e Luigi and
        Topolino) in August 2015 from the
        <a href="https://www.sfspca.org/">San Francisco SPCA</a>. Their blurb
        was short and to-the-point:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Topolino is a gentle soul. Luigi is a lovely fellow. These two boys are
        on the shy side but warm up quickly to show what sweet guys they are.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Both cats made an immediate impression when they greeted visitors at the
        door of their temporary room at the SFSPCA without trying to squirt out
        the door into the hallway. Sirius closed the deal by immediately
        crawling into Caitlin's then-roommate's lap and purring. Remus was
        hesitant but curious, but quickly lit up when the SPCA volunteer brought
        out a laser pointer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just before the cats were scheduled to be sent to a different SPCA
        facility, Caitlin started the adoption paperwork. The cats went to their
        new forever home that night and were renamed after two of Caitlin's
        favorite characters from Harry Potter, Remus Lupin and Sirius Black.
      </p>
      <p>
        As advertised, Remus and Sirius are both gentle, lovely cats. They enjoy
        spending time with their humans and can frequently be found snuggling
        together. They provide endless amusement for Potch and Caitlin.

          Caitlin considered naming them Tom and Ziggy, after David Bowie's
          Major Tom and Ziggy Stardust.
